# Miss You 3000
A repository for a small script writter by me to alert when Avengers' Tickets are made availble on cinemas.
OLD CODE - NOT TO RELY ( 'pun intended' )

## Throw Back Story
Last year, at this time. 'Avengers : End Game' was being released.
Like everyone, I was waiting to watch the movie on first day.
But I had bad experience while booking tickets in my college City.
We couldn't book tickets for Captain Marvel as they put tickets online on some random time instead of promised time .

Hence I had to write a python script which alerts me on my mail when tickets are made available. Yes It worked.


## Module Used
- Beautiful Soup  : for scraping web content and check for the movie
- SMTP Mailer  : to send mail over SMTP.



PS : I had to use Paytm as we bought some vouchers for Marvel movies.

'RIP Black Widow and Iron Man'
